# Input Remapper Autoload

## Description

This is a service to autoload the input remapper configurations. This should be done by the input remapper itself, but it doesn't work for some reason.

## Set up

- The shell script should be placed in `/usr/local/bin/`
- The service file should be placed in `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`
